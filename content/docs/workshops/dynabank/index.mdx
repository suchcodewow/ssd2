This is designed as an instructor led workshop taking around 3h 30m.

Please join us in a hands-on workshop where we'll use the power of Dynatrace automation and AI to deploy a real-world application from scratch, immediately get answers to user impacting problems, and encourage collaboration across all IT teams.

It requires login credentials provided by your instructor. If you're interested in running this workshop yourself or with your organization, please [contact us](https://www.dynatrace.com/contact/)!
