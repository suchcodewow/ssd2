## Environment setup

We'll spin up a Dynatrace tenant and build an application together from scratch.

Please keep in mind that this is a "live-fire" experience. It's instructor led- but can be more like white-water rafting than a museum tour.

Please let us know how it's going with thumbs up reactions when it's good sailing and chat/speak up if things are tipping over.

## A) Dynatrace tenant setup

1. Launch the [Dyantrace trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial/) page.
2. Enter an email address and "Start free trial".
3. Follow the prompts.
4. Check email (junk/spam folders!) for a "Welcome" message.

## B) Cloud setup

1. Dynatrace works natively across cloud providers. Follow the instructor prompts to connect to your selected environment.
2. Once logged in check the section below matching your provider.

### AWS

1. In the top right bar, confirm the region is Ohio. If not, click the region and select "US EAST (OHIO)"
   ![regionselect](/img/preflight1.jpg)
2. You have full access to the various features of AWS. You could search for "Elastic Kubernetes Service" or "EC2". Aside from a Cloudformation VPC, everything should be empty as we'll build it all today.
3. in the top bar, open an AWS cloud shell session by clicking the shell icon.
   ![cloudshell](/img/preflight2.jpg)
4. If the text is ridiculously tiny, there is a gear icon in the top right you can select to pick something other than "microscopic".

### AZURE

1. Click the shell icon in the top bar of the Azure portal login.

2. The setup steps should automatically connect you to the correct subscription.
3. A resource group will be created for you during setup steps. You'll have full access to all items in this group.

### GCLOUD

1. In your google cloud console, start a shell from the prompt icon top right.
   ![cloudgoogle](/img/cloudgoogle.jpg)
2. You have full access to the **project** in Google Cloud. Ensure you select your designated project during setup steps.

## C) Setup

We'll use [Pepper](/docs/pepper) today. It's a cloud-agnostic deployment assistant built to help setup applications while providing every step along the way. (No magic whooosh then done!)

1. In your cloud shell, download Pepper.

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 > ~/pepper.ps1
```

2. Start Pepper with the `-c` option to show commands as they run so you could use them manually later, and `-n` option to specify the existing VPC.

```bash
pwsh ./pepper.ps1 -c
```

:::info
Pepper will generate a running checklist of deployment items. Anything showing `[-]` is information, while anything with `[>]` shows the exact command you could run yourself with everything filled it.
:::

3. You should see something similar to below. Select any items marked `Required`. The step that builds your kubernetes cluster takes some time across all cloud providers. (Some take more than others. _sideways glance at AWS_)

```bash
Option description                     current
------ -----------                     -------
     1 Switch Cloud Provider           AWS us-east-2/bravecannon
     2 Required: Create AWS Components
```

:::info
The first line shows which cloud provider you're using, the space within that cloud, and a unique identifier. If used in a local terminal with multiple available cloud providers, the option to `switch cloud providers` would let you switch between them.

## Section Complete!

Congratulations, you've built an AWS cluster!
