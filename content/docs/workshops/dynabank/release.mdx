## The story so far

The organization is implementing a fraud detection service.

- Large transactions are targets for fraud.
- The fraud service will check those transactions for address and account owner details prior to posting them.
- Users should receive a transaction error message when fraud is detected.

As developers:

- we've confirmed the solution works on our dev laptops.
- We've staged the change as a feature flag in the application's main API.
- At 4:50PM Friday we put on our jackets, enable the flag, and start a week long beach vacation.
